# Werhy / Vicont extension

This local fork adds Vicont BLE controls and an experimental Apple Watch Series 2 companion.
It is not yet verified on a physical scooter or watch.
Start with [the setup guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) and [validation results](docs/VALIDATION.md).
See [protocol evidence](docs/VICONT_PROTOCOL.md) and [watch support](docs/APPLE_WATCH.md).

# eScive

eScive is a mobile app that aims to be a third-party client for e-scooters with Bluetooth functionality, allowing an alternative interface with more features, and more importantly, without all the telemetry that is included in some official apps (generally Chinese ones 👀).

For now, the project specifically targets iScooter "i10" electric scooters, but is coded in a way that will allow other brands in the future.
Communications between devices are based on reverse engineering of packets sent using the BLE protocols, and directly from the decompiled source code of official apps.

## Installation

### Android

The app is not *officialy* available on the Play Store.  
You can download it using the latest APK provided in the latest [release](https://github.com/johan-perso/escive/releases/latest) of this repository.

> You can also join the [closed beta](https://johanstick.fr/escive-en-androidbeta) to receive updates via the Play Store. You will have to wait to be accepted, so it is recommended to download the APK to start using the app.

### iOS

The app is not available on the App Store, and will probably not be for a while because of the costs of publishing it (99$/year).  
However, if you are willing to do some more complex manipulations, you can ["sideload"](https://read.johanstick.fr/sideload-ios/) it on your device from the IPA file provided in the latest [release](https://github.com/johan-perso/escive/releases/latest) of this repository.

## Automation

### Protocol

You can directly open the app on your phone from a URL starting with `escive://`. Depending on the URL, you can choose any predefined actions from the list below that will be done as soon as possible.
